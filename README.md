*What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problems we were solving for this course was deciding what data structures when used in specific scenarios would provide the best and most efficient results. 

*How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

The way to solve the problem is to discern each data structures’ strengths and weaknesses and decide whether they are the best for the job. Vector structures are best for straightforward inserting and deleting nodes that are not located in the first or last position. Hash tables are best for  locating and returning specific node placements in larger complex systems. Binary trees are best at locating and returning specific values in smaller less complex systems.


*How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The best way to overcome roadblocks was to imagine how the code will be used and determine the overall efficiency that each data structure will provide when used in the way that the specific code requires. As covered in the previous answer, each data structure has a scenario where it will be the most efficient for the job required, and as programmers it is our job to be able to think ahead and understand what is needed of the program and which structure will provide the best most efficient results for these specifications.


*How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

These projects opened my mind to the fact that simply solving the problem and creating a program that technically works isn’t always good enough, and this the steps involved and the process the program takes to get to its final destination ultimately makes a difference in the effectiveness and efficiency with which to program runs, while minimizing the room for error or misinterpretation.


*How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Systems that use the proper data structures will not only be easier for the program to read and return values, but it also makes the jobs of the developers easier by not having unnecessary extra steps involved that can provide issues for them further down the line. Choosing the proper data structure will allow the developers to
